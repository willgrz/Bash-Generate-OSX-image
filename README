This creates OSX bootable ISO files (on a Mac/via modified EFI/extra bootloader/VM) from Apple supplied OS X installers (Appstore, *.app).

Nothing special, feed it a DMG file (InstallESD.dmg in Install*/Contents/SharedSupport/ on OSX 10.9+) and it gives you an ISO in the same dir as the DMG is in.
ISO has same name as source DMG.
Do not use spaces in DMG filename.

>Why same dir? 
As i did not copy the entire *.app folder and the creation actually does not need anything besides the DMG i just copied the DMGs to "VERSION.dmg" (i.e. Yosemite.dmg)
and let this script loop over it, creating me ISOs for all 10.9+ in one run.

This is mainly based on something i found here:

Edits took around 10min.


Usage:
# bash -x conv.sh /Users/william/ISO/new/Yosemite.dmg

Gives:
# ls -la /Users/william/ISO/new/Yosemite.iso
